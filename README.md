# Watashi no shashin

## Game entry for js13kGames 2018

> Tony must send selfies to his followers on the internet to document his day at the local shoping mall. His mom is picking him up in 1 hour so he must gain as many likes as possible before she arrives.
>
> As Tony, you must search the mall for a wifi signal (indicated top right) and take a selfie with a relevant txt.
>
> Press [B] to open your phone when you have a signal and press [Space] repeatedly to type a txt.

> When done the green send button will activate, press [return] to send.
> The stronger your signal, the faster you can enter text.

> When the trolls see that you have a signal they will try and get to it also, too many users at a wifi hotspot will drop the signal and you will be 'Offline'. The lower the trolls using your hotspot the more likes you are likely to get.

> Haters will chase you, and may send dislikes about your selfies.
